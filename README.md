# Learning React Native
This is a fully functional app I built to learn React Native. It is for people to find local jobs and uses the Jobsearch API. There is no backend as of now, but this is something I may come back to in the future.
# Deployment
This app is deployed with Expo. In order to see it in action, please go to this link: https://expo.dev/@sriharik844/ReactNativeTutApp?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go.
