# React Native Job Finder
This is React Native app I built to help users find jobs. It uses the JobSearch API to find jobs, and renders them. There is no backend as of now, but this is something I may come back to in the future. The main reason I built this app was to gain familiarity with React Native and expo, which this processed certainly helped with.
# Deployment
This app is deployed with Expo. In order to see it in action, please go to this link: https://expo.dev/@sriharik844/ReactNativeTutApp?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go.
