# Learning React Native
This is an app I built following a tutorial so I could learn about React Native. It happens to be a job finder app, not to be confused with Clover, the React job-finder WEB app that I'm currently building. 
# Deployment
This app is deployed with Expo. In order to see it in action, please go to this link: https://expo.dev/@sriharik844/ReactNativeTutApp?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go. Due to some expo issues, it might not be visible to everyone, in which case please visit this link to see a quick demo video I recorded: .
